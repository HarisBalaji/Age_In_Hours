# Age_In_Hours

- My First Application

- User has to select some date(eg.DOB). UI tells about how many hours you have gone through from the selected date

- Learned basic LinearLayout, Textview, Buttons, DatePickerDialog, Calendar(Abstract class), SimpleDateFormat(Class for formatting and parsing dates in a locale-sensitivemanner), Toasts, checking attributes nullable or not
